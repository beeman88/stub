How to install the stub and curl?

in my transfer/bryanb/bb_integration
Python26.zip unzip to C:\Python26
curl.zip unsip to C:\curl

Add C:\Python26 to system path

How to run?
Open Dos window, cmd
cd c:\Python26
python stub.py

How does stub.py work?
matches an url and response with the contents of an xml file
sometimes a response status code is set 200, 401, 302
sometimes a response header location is set to an url

Open Dos window
cd C:\curl
curl_stub 8080 abc42b0d-d110-4f5c-ac79-d3aa11bd20cb

What does curl_stub do?
curl_stub sends a series of requests that simulate a link and sync of customers

What does curl_stub output?
A log file in C:\Python26\8080\log.csv
Lists requests, debugging and the xml response

How are the test cases organized?
Each test case has a folder in C:\Python26
the folder is also used for the port number
eg folder 8080 has xml files and curl_stub will call http://localhost:8080/...
eg folder 8081 has xml files and curl_stub will call http://localhost:8081/...
readme.txt contains the curl_stub command used for the test case

How to set up tests?
Copy a port folder
in the port folder are xml repsonses, config, readme
config has the sync uuid
readme has test case description including uuid and curl_stub command
xml files has the responses
the xml files are changed to create the tests - look out for uuids, tick
