How are the test cases organized?
Each test case has a folder in C:\Python26
the folder is also used for the port number
eg folder 8080 has xml files and curl_stub will call http://localhost:8080/...
eg folder 8081 has xml files and curl_stub will call http://localhost:8081/...

config has the sync uuid
readme has test case description including uuid and curl_stub command
